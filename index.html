                A recurrence relation is a functional relation between the independent variable x, dependent variable f(x), and the differences of various orders of f(x). A recurrence relation is also called a difference equation, and we will use these two terms interchangeably.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> The equation f(x + 3h) + 3f(x + 2h) + 6f(x + h) + 9f(x) = 0 is a recurrence relation. It can also be written as:
                <br><br>
                a<sub>r+3</sub> + 3a<sub>r+2</sub> + 6a<sub>r+1</sub> + 9a<sub>r</sub> = 0
                <br>
                y<sub>k+3</sub> + 3y<sub>k+2</sub> + 6y<sub>k+1</sub> + 9y<sub>k</sub> = 0
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation a<sub>r</sub> = a<sub>r-2</sub> + a<sub>r-1</sub>, r ≥ 2, with the initial conditions a<sub>0</sub> = 1 and a<sub>1</sub> = 1.
            </p>
            <h3>Order of the Recurrence Relation:</h3>
            <p>
                The order of the recurrence relation or difference equation is defined to be the difference between the highest and lowest subscripts of f(x) or a<sub>r</sub> = y<sub>k</sub>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> The equation 13a<sub>r</sub> + 20a<sub>r-1</sub> = 0 is a first order recurrence relation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> The equation 8f(x) + 4f(x + 1) + 8f(x + 2) = k(x)
            </p>
            <h3>Degree of the Difference Equation:</h3>
            <p>
                The degree of a difference equation is defined to be the highest power of f(x) or a<sub>r</sub> = y<sub>k</sub>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> The equation y<sup>3</sup><sub>k+3</sub> + 2y<sup>2</sup><sub>k+2</sub> + 2y<sub>k+1</sub> = 0 has the degree 3, as the highest power of y<sub>k</sub> is 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> The equation a<sup>4</sup><sub>r</sub> + 3a<sup>3</sup><sub>r-1</sub> + 6a<sup>2</sup><sub>r-2</sub> + 4a<sub>r-3</sub> = 0 has the degree 4, as the highest power of a<sub>r</sub> is 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 3:</strong> The equation y<sub>k+3</sub> + 2y<sub>k+2</sub> + 4y<sub>k+1</sub> + 2y<sub>k</sub> = k(x) has the degree 1, because the highest power of y<sub>k</sub> is 1 and its order is 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 4:</strong> The equation f(x+2h) - 4f(x+h) + 2f(x) = 0 has the degree 1 and its order is 2.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                A recurrence relation is a mathematical expression that defines a sequence in terms of its previous terms.
                In the context of algorithmic analysis, it is often used to model the time complexity of recursive algorithms.
                <br><br>
                General form of a Recurrence Relation: 
                <br> <strong> f<sub>n</sub> = f(a<sub>n-1</sub>, a<sub>n-2</sub>, …., a<sub>n-k</sub>) </strong>
                <br><br>
                where f is a function that defines the relationship between the current term and the previous terms.           
                More precisely, in the case where only the immediately preceding element is involved, a recurrence relation 
                has the form:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <strong>u<sub>n</sub> = φ(n, u<sub>n-1</sub>) for n &gt; 0</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                where φ: ℕ × X → X is a function, where X is a set to which the elements of a sequence must belong. 
                For any u<sub>0</sub> ∈ X, this defines a unique sequence with u<sub>0</sub> as its first element, called the initial value.
            </p>
            <p>
                This defines a recurrence relation of first order. A recurrence relation of order k has the form:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <strong>u<sub>n</sub> = φ(n, u<sub>n-1</sub>, u<sub>n-2</sub>, ..., u<sub>n-k</sub>) for n ≥ k</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                where φ: ℕ × X<sup>k</sup> → X is a function that involves k consecutive elements of the sequence. 
                In this case, k initial values are needed for defining a sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recurrence relations can be classified into different types, such as homogeneous and non-homogeneous, each with its unique characteristics and applications.
                Understanding these concepts is crucial for dealing with recursive structures and dynamic programming.

            <h2>Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</h2>
            A homogeneous recurrence relation is a relation in which each term is a function of the preceding terms.
            It follows the form:
            <p><strong>T(n) = a<sub>1</sub> * T(n-1) + a<sub>2</sub> * T(n-2) + ... + a<sub>k</sub> * T(n-k)</strong></p>
            <br>
            These relations often appear in problems involving recursive structures, such as computing Fibonacci numbers.
            The main characteristic of homogeneous relations is that they do not have any additional independent terms.
            <br>

    </section>

    <section id="non-homogeneous">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                In contrast, a non-homogeneous recurrence relation includes an additional independent function of n,
                making the relation of the form:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <strong>T(n) = a<sub>1</sub> * T(n-1) + a<sub>2</sub> * T(n-2) + ... + a<sub>k</sub> * T(n-k) + f(n)</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                A non-homogeneous recurrence relation has an associated homogeneous recurrence relation where the function f(n) is zero. The general solution of the non-homogeneous recurrence relation is the sum of two parts:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <strong>a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>h</sub> + a<sub>t</sub></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                where a<sub>h</sub> is the solution of the associated homogeneous recurrence relation, and a<sub>t</sub> is a particular solution to the non-homogeneous recurrence relation.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the particular solution, we consider an appropriate trial solution. For example, if the function f(n) is a polynomial or exponential function, we select a trial solution that matches the form of f(n).
            </p>
            <p>
                Let f(n) = c * x<sup>n</sup> and let x<sup>2</sup> = Ax + B be the characteristic equation of the associated homogeneous recurrence relation. Let x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> be the roots of this equation.
            </p>
            <div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>If x ≠ x<sub>1</sub> and x ≠ x<sub>2</sub>, then a<sub>t</sub> = Ax<sup>n</sup></li>
                    <li>If x = x<sub>1</sub>, x ≠ x<sub>2</sub>, then a<sub>t</sub> = Anx<sup>n</sup></li>
                    <li>If x = x<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>, then a<sub>t</sub> = An<sup>2</sup>x<sup>n</sup></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                These cases help determine the form of the particular solution depending on the nature of the roots of the characteristic equation.
