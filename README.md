# Recurrence Relations Website

## Overview

This project is a website designed to help students understand recurrence relations, a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science. The website offers explanations, examples, and a visual tool to generate recurrence trees, providing a hands-on approach to learning.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Content**: Detailed explanations of both homogeneous and non-homogeneous recurrence relations.
- **Visual Tree Generator**: A tool to visualize the structure of recurrence relations, helping users grasp complex concepts more easily.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design, ensuring a seamless learning experience.

## Sections

- **Basics**: An introduction to recurrence relations with examples and definitions.
- **Introduction**: A deeper dive into the general form and classification of recurrence relations.
- **Homogeneous Recurrence Relations**: Detailed information on relations where each term is a function of the preceding terms.
- **Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Relations**: Exploration of recurrence relations that include additional independent functions.
- **Recurrence Relation Tree Generator**: A tool to visualize different recurrence relations and their corresponding trees.

## Getting Started

To explore the content and use the recurrence tree generator, simply navigate through the sections provided in the website.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

No installation is required. This is a static website that can be hosted on any web server or viewed locally by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Usage

1. **Navigate through Sections**: Use the navigation bar to explore the different sections of the website.
2. **Generate Recurrence Trees**: Go to the "Recurrence Relation Tree Generator" section, choose your relation, input parameters, and generate the corresponding tree.
3. **The relations focused for visualization**: 
   1. T(n) = T(n-x) + a<sub>0</sub>
   2. T(n) = T(n-x) + T(n-y)
