Recurrence Tree Generator

I am trying to build a recurrence tree generator, which should be able to generate a tree representing the input recurrence relation. The input recurrence relation is what I have kept it in a default standard format and, have enabled options to input coefficients for the default terms in the relation and for number of nodes and depth.

Right now, a basic web page is created, which just displays the number of nodes.
I have to make the tree such that, the value of nodes are also displayed in the nodes.
